# ðŸš¨ URGENT: Remove rate_limit from Caddyfile

## Issue
GitHub Actions deployment failing with:
```
Error: adapting config using caddyfile: /etc/caddy/Caddyfile:62: unrecognized directive: rate_limit
```

## Root Cause
Stock `caddy:2-alpine` image doesn't include the rate_limit module.

## Fix Applied âœ…
Removed all `rate_limit` sections from Caddyfile:
- Removed rate limiting configuration block
- Removed API route rate limiting
- Added comment explaining removal

## Deploy Immediately
```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "URGENT: Remove rate_limit from Caddyfile - not available in stock Caddy"
git push origin main
```

## Expected Result
- Deployment completes successfully
- All containers start properly
- SSL certificate provisions for getklario.com
- Site accessible at https://getklario.com

**Status: Ready for immediate deployment** ðŸš€
