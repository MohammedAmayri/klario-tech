# 🔍 DEPLOYMENT FAILURE ANALYSIS

## Issue Summary
From GitHub Actions logs:
- `klario-app` container: `Exit 1` (crashing on startup)
- `caddy-proxy`: "lookup klario-app on 127.0.0.11:53: server misbehaving" 
- `curl not found` - Docker image rebuild incomplete due to app crash

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Application Startup Failure
The Express app has a simple `/health` endpoint that should work:
```typescript
app.get('/health', (req, res) => {
  res.status(200).json({ 
    status: 'healthy', 
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    environment: process.env.NODE_ENV || 'development'
  });
});
```

### 2. Potential Issues
- Missing environment variables in production
- Database connection issues during startup
- Static file serving path problems in Docker
- Missing build artifacts

### 3. Network Issues
- Caddy can't resolve `klario-app` because container is down
- Docker networking works, but container exits before DNS registration

## Solutions to Implement
1. ✅ Fix Docker build artifacts and static file paths
2. ✅ Add startup error logging and graceful failure handling  
3. ✅ Ensure curl is available for health checks
4. ✅ Add container restart policies for resilience
5. ✅ Validate all required environment variables at startup
