Right—those Cf-* headers don’t mean you have Cloudflare in front of the site; they mean someone (scanners, bots, or Cloudflare Workers) is hitting your domain through Cloudflare’s network. That’s noise and not the root cause of Caddy not obtaining a cert for getklario.com.

We need to get clarity on what Caddy actually thinks is configured, and then force it to do the ACME flow for getklario.com/www.getklario.com. Here’s the plan:

1. Inspect Caddy’s live effective config from inside the container
Run this to dump what Caddy has loaded and see what domains it’s managing TLS for:

sh
Copy
Edit
docker exec caddy-proxy curl localhost:2019/config/ | head -500
Paste the output here. We’re looking for the site block(s) and the automatic_https/TLS domain list—this will tell us whether Caddy recognized getklario.com (and www.getklario.com) as hosts it should manage.

2. Ensure the Caddyfile declares both names in one block
Update the top of your Caddyfile to this (so the cert covers both and there’s no ambiguity):

caddy
Copy
Edit
getklario.com, www.getklario.com {
    reverse_proxy klario-app:5000 {
        health_uri /health
        health_interval 10s
        health_timeout 5s
        lb_policy round_robin
        transport http {
            dial_timeout 10s
            response_header_timeout 30s
            expect_continue_timeout 5s
            keepalive 30s
            keepalive_idle_conns 10
        }
        header_up Host {upstream_hostport}
        header_up X-Real-IP {remote_host}
        header_up X-Forwarded-For {remote_host}
        header_up X-Forwarded-Proto {scheme}
    }

    # ... the rest of your headers, rate limiting, encode, logging, etc.
}
Remove the separate www.getklario.com redirect block for now (you can later add a canonical redirect inside this block if desired).

3. Format, reload, and restart to force fresh TLS evaluation
sh
Copy
Edit
docker exec caddy-proxy caddy fmt --overwrite /etc/caddy/Caddyfile
docker exec caddy-proxy caddy reload --config /etc/caddy/Caddyfile
docker restart caddy-proxy
4. Trigger the ACME issuance
sh
Copy
Edit
curl -v http://getklario.com/health
That should cause Caddy to attempt the HTTP-01 challenge for getklario.com (and www.getklario.com implicitly because they’re in the same block).

5. Check logs for certificate acquisition
sh
Copy
Edit
docker logs --tail=80 caddy-proxy
You should now see:

enabling automatic TLS certificate management including both domains

trying to obtain certificate for getklario.com

ACME challenge progress and success.

6. Validate HTTPS
sh
Copy
Edit
curl -v https://getklario.com/health
curl -v https://www.getklario.com/health
echo | openssl s_client -connect getklario.com:443 -servername getklario.com 2>/dev/null | openssl x509 -noout -text
If it still doesn’t attempt cert issuance
Send me:

The output of docker exec caddy-proxy curl localhost:2019/config/ | head -500

The tail of docker logs --tail=80 caddy-proxy right after you did the HTTP request

The exact current top ~40 lines of your Caddyfile to verify syntax

We’ll pinpoint whether it’s a parsing issue, a hostname mismatch, or something subtle preventing ACME from engaging.
